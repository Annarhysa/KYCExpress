# KYCExpress
An online video KYC solution.\
We are team CodeX and we have developed a web application for Standard Chartered Hackathon

## About
Currently Know Your Customer (KYC) is largely an offline and manual process OR non-interactive online process. Creating an online interactive process to do video KYC could become intuitive and self-sufficient. The KYC captures the userâ€™s live photograph and their basic details like name, DOB, address, pan card / Aadhaar, signature, income range, type of employment in a conversational manner. This tool is highly inclusive and has high reach across languages and generations irrespective of financial and education gap. 

## Purpose
- Revolutionize the KYC process with a seamless and efficient video verification method.
- Enhance customer experience by enabling remote identity verification.
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements while reducing operational costs.
